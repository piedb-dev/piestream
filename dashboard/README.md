The framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

Next.js supports SPA, SSG and SSR. With this feature, the dashboard ui can be deployed in
1. Standalone machine serving only dashboard UI with a backend. (e.g. Dashboard for cloud product)
2. Meta service node. (e.g. Static HTML files integrated in meta service without any other dependencies like node.js)

## Files
```
dashboard/
--.next/ (generated by nextjs)
--node_modules/ (development dependencies)
--out/ (generated static files)
--components/ (React Component)

## Testing
TODO: Find a suitable testing framework

## Development
Start the piestream database, remove drop tables from `tpch_snapshot.slt`
```bash
./risedev d
sqllogictest -p 4566 -d dev './e2e_test/streaming/tpch_snapshot.slt'
```
Install Dependencies.
```bash
npm i
```
The website will be served at port 3000.
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should also run:
```
node mock-server.js
```
To start a mock API server when developing. You can use `fetch.sh` to update the mock APIs.

## Test with piestream meta node
To replace the built static files in piestream with your newest code, 
run the following scripts in the root directory.
```
./risedev export-dashboard-v2
```


## Deployment
#### Static HTML files
Build static files for standalone deployment without node.js. The built files are generated at `./out`.
Check more details at [Static HTML Export](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export).
```bash
npm run build-static
```

#### Next.js app
The built files are generated at `./.next`.
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
