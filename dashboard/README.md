1. Standalone machine serving only dashboard UI with a backend. (e.g. Dashboard for cloud product)
2. Meta service node. (e.g. Static HTML files integrated in meta service without any other dependencies like node.js)

To replace the built static files in RisingWave with your newest code, 
run the following scripts in the root directory.
```
./risedev export-dashboard-v2

Check more details at [Static HTML Export](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export).
```bash
npm run build-static
```

#### Next.js app
The built files are generated at `./.next`.
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
